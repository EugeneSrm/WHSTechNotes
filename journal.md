Ai can help one study to a  better degrre then any person due to the fact that any ai can easily access any and all types of imformation instantly. Putting this to use for studying students could optimize what they learn to an absurd degree. turning hours upon hours of studying take less then 45 minutes. I can see myself using it ti help me study it is incredibly efficent in comparison to doing it yourself. it's like having a mathmatican in your pocket if need be.

Ban's like that are wonderful in theroy however in practice it's much diffrent. Student's can and will become antsy due to not being able to be on there phone's. Not only that but students will likely just become more snaky and secretive about the way that they go about being on there phone. It could also very much cause the students to dread coming to school even more then they do already. 

Under the unfortunate but real circumstances of a school shooting not being able to be on your phone in that situation can casue mass panic amongst students. Not being abe to contact anyone on the outside could be very mentally taxing to the students. Causing the entire situation to flip out of control more then it already would. I belive bans like these are more detrimaental to the students then they would be benifical.
